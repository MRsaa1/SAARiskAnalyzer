🔹 Platform Status
Status: Analytical Platform (Controlled Preview)
Access Mode: Read-only analytics & research workflows
Execution / Trading: Not supported
Intended Use: Risk research, stress analysis, model exploration
This platform does not provide investment advice, portfolio recommendations, or execution capabilities.

🎯 Overview
SAA Risk Analyzer enables structured exploration of portfolio risk behavior under various market conditions through:
quantitative risk metric computation
scenario-based stress analysis
historical backtesting of risk models
analytical visualization of portfolio sensitivities
It is intended for researchers, risk analysts, and institutional research teams.

🚀 Core Analytical Capabilities
📐 Risk Metric Analytics
Value-at-Risk (VaR): Historical, Parametric, Monte Carlo
Conditional VaR / Expected Shortfall (CVaR)
Portfolio risk decomposition (component & marginal contribution)
Correlation structure analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for factor exploration
All outputs are analytical representations, not predictive guarantees.

🧪 Stress Research Framework
Historical market stress scenarios (e.g. 2008, 2020)
User-defined analytical shocks
Correlation regime exploration
Cross-asset sensitivity analysis
Stress scenarios are used solely for analytical exploration.

📉 Backtesting & Model Diagnostics
Statistical validation of risk model behavior
Violation frequency analysis
Independence and clustering diagnostics
Visual inspection tools (QQ plots, exceedance charts)
Backtesting is intended for model research and validation, not certification.
